# Stig's Facebook Homefeed Cleanr

Stig's Facebook Homefeed Cleanr is a browser userscript for cleaning up the homefeed on Facebook. Removes or highlights Suggested Posts and Sponsored content from the homefeed.

**Warning!** My current prioritization of maintaining this userscript is rather low, so I have decided to remove it from Greasy Fork. You might of course still install it here from GitHub, but fixing bugs and developing new features wont happen very fast.

If you are a developer, you are of course very welcome to fork my code and create a new userscript based on what I've started.
